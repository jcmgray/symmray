    """Generate two random symmetric arrays and valid contraction ``axes``.
    For testing purposes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    symmetry : str or Symmetry
        Symmetry to use.
    ndim_a : int or None
        Number of dimensions for the first array. If None, a random number is
        chosen between `min_ndim` and `max_ndim` (inclusive).
    ndim_b : int or None
        Number of dimensions for the second array. If None, a random number is
        chosen between `min_ndim` and `max_ndim` (inclusive).
    ncon : int or None
        Number of axes to contract. If None, a random number is chosen between
        0 and min(ndim_a, ndim_b) (inclusive).
    charge_a : charge_like or None
        Charge for the first array. If None, a random charge is chosen.
    charge_b : charge_like or None
        Charge for the second array. If None, a random charge is chosen.
    min_ndim : int
        Minimum number of dimensions for each array.
    max_ndim : int
        Maximum number of dimensions for each array.
    min_d : int
        Minimum dimension for each index. This is multiplied by
        `dimension_multiplier` if that is not None.
    max_d : int
        Maximum dimension for each index. This is multiplied by
        `dimension_multiplier` if that is not None.
    dimension_multiplier : int, optional
        Each index will have dimension `d * dimension_multiplier` where `d`
        is a random integer in [min_d, max_d]. Useful for generating flat
        arrays with exactly equally distributed charge sizes.
    subsizes : str or None
        Passed to `rand_index`. If "equal", all sectors will have equal size,
        required for flat arrays.
    seed : int or np.random.Generator or None
        Random seed or generator. If None, a new generator is created.
    **kwargs
        Additional arguments passed to `get_rand`.

    Returns
    -------
    a : AbelianArray
        First random array.
    b : AbelianArray
        Second random array.
    axes : tuple[tuple[int, ...], tuple[int, ...]]
        Axes to contract.
